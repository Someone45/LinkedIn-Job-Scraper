# Scraper

To begin using this script, you will need to install all of the modules found in "LinkedIn_Scraper"

You will need to edit the login information with that of your LinkedIN account

When running the script, you can do so through "Run_Scraper.py", but make sure to edit the search criteria and number of iterations
to the keywords and number that you desire. There will be more updates to provide a GUI that allows you to input this data with the
addition of other data to expand the preferences you can pick when scraping for a certain job or internship.

Please contact me with any questions or bugs that need to be fixed.
